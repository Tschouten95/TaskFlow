🧩 Project Request: “TaskFlow” — A Team Task Management API

Client brief:

“We need a backend API for a lightweight team task management app called TaskFlow. Each team has multiple users, and each user can create, assign, and track tasks. We’ll later build a frontend on top of your API, so for now, focus purely on the backend.”

🎯 Core Requirements
1. Authentication & Authorization

Implement JWT authentication (e.g., using Laravel Sanctum or Passport).

Endpoints for:

POST /register — register a new user

POST /login — authenticate and get token

POST /logout — revoke token

2. Teams

Users can create and join teams.

A team can have many users.

Only the team owner can remove members.

Endpoints:

POST /teams — create a team

POST /teams/{team}/members — invite/add a user

DELETE /teams/{team}/members/{user} — remove a user

GET /teams — list teams the user is part of

3. Tasks

Each task belongs to a team and is assigned to a user (optional).

A task has: title, description, status (todo, in_progress, done), priority, due_date.

Endpoints:

GET /teams/{team}/tasks — list all tasks in a team

POST /teams/{team}/tasks — create a task

PUT /tasks/{task} — update a task

DELETE /tasks/{task} — delete a task

PATCH /tasks/{task}/status — change status

4. Notifications (Bonus Challenge)

When a task is assigned to a user, send them an in-app notification (store in DB).

Endpoint: GET /notifications — list unread notifications.

5. Extras (Stretch Goals)

Use API Resources for clean JSON responses.

Add validation using Form Requests.

Write Feature Tests for main endpoints.

Add API rate limiting and handle unauthorized access properly.

Deploy to a free platform like Render, Railway, or Vercel (with Laravel API).
